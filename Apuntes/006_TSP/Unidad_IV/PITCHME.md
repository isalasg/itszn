### @color[brown](4.1. Introducción)
- In the requirements phase the team produces the software requirements specification (SRS). The SRS should provide a clear unambiguous description of what the product is to be, and it should include precise criteria for evaluating the finished product to ensure that it does what it is supposed to do. The SRS also provides feedback to the customer on what you intend to build.

### @color[brown](4.1. Introducción)
- Many inexperienced engineers think that requirements work is waste of time, to them, coding and testing seem like the real development work. The planning, requirements, and design work, however, are what make the difference between successful projects and failures. Think requirements as a map. If you were in a hurry to go someplace and you were not sure how to get there, you would probably take a few minutes to consult a map. Otherwise, you could end driving at high speed in the wrong direction.

### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Entry Criteria)
- The entry criteria for the requirements process are as follows:
    + You have a development strategy and plan.
    + You have the conceptual design, which was produced during strategy development.

### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 1. Need Statement Review
    + The development manager leads the team to formulate questions about the functions to be performed by the product and how these functions are to be used.
    + All the questions must be clarified among the team members or noted for discussion with the client.

#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 2. Need Statement Clarification
    + The development manager review the list of questions and the team's clarification notes wit the client.
    + The development manager can have a private meeting with the client or hold the review in a team meeting.

#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 3. Requirements Task
    + The development manager leads the team through outlining the SRS document and the work to produce it

---
### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 4. Task Allocation
    + The team leader helps allocate the tasks among the team members and obtains commitments for when they will complete these tasks

---
### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 5. Requirements Documentation
    + Each team member produces and reviews his or her portions of the SRS document.
    + Provides these to the development manager.
    + The developer manager produces the SRS draft.

#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 6. System Test Plan
    + The development manager leads the team in producing and review the system test plan

---
### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 7. Requirements and System Test Plan Inspection
    + The quality/process manager leads the team througth:
        * Inspection the SRS draft and System Test Plan.
        * Indentifying questions and problems.
        * Defining who will resolve each question and problem.
        * Documenting the inspection.

### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 8. Requirements Update
    + The development manager obtains the updated SRS sections and combines them into a final SRS.

---
### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 9. User SRS Review
    + The development manager provides a copy of the final SRS to the client for approval.

#### @color[orange](Activities)
- 10. Requirements Baseline
    + The support manager baselines the SRS.

---
### @color[brown](4.2. Proceso de requerimientos)
#### @color[orange](Exit Criteria)
- A completed and inspected SRS document and system test plan.
- A completed time, defect and size data entered in the TSP support system.

---
### @color[brown](4.3. Especificación de requerimientos de software)
- The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes what do you plan to develop and how you intend the product to perform. 
- There are many standars for SRS documents, however, you will concentrate on the functional and operational requirements.

---
### @color[brown](4.3. Especificación de requerimientos de software)
- The principal topics to address ares:
    + Functional requirements: inputs, outputs, calculations, and use cases.
    + External interface requirements: user, hardware, software, communications.
    + Design constraints: file formats, languages, standars, compatibility.

---
### @color[brown](4.3. Especificación de requerimientos de software)
- The principal topics to address ares:
    + Attributes: availability, security, maintainability, conversion.
    + Other requirements: database, installation.
