### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- Team Software Process (TSP) guides engineering teams that are @color[green](developing software-intensive products). Using TSP helps organizations establish a mature and disciplined engineering practice that produces @color[green](secure, reliable software in less time and at lower costs).

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- TSP has been applied in small and large organizations in a variety of domains with similar results on first use, including
    - @color[green](productivity improvements) of 25% or more
    - @color[green](reductions in cost and schedule) variance to less than +/- 10%
    - @color[green](testing costs and schedule reductions) of up to 80%

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- Software underlies advances in many areas, including medicine, science, weapons systems, and commerce. Software technology has advanced at an incredible pace, but the ability to manage software development and the quality of the software produced has not kept pace.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- The software industry is the only high-tech industry that relies on testing to address quality and reliability issues. This is a strategy that cannot work, as evidenced by increases in serious system failures and software security and safety issues.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- TSP @color[green](reduces) the number of post-release @color[green](defects by 80% or more), so systems produced with TSP are more reliable and less likely to have latent defects that lead to these serious concerns.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- TSP is an operational, @color[green](“how-to”) implementation of the @color[green](principles and best practices) that the SEI has advocated since its inception. TSP also includes many concepts that have not been implemented in other engineering methods, including:
    + self-directed team management 
    + an integrated measurement framework

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.1 Definición)
- cont...
    + a comprehensive, pre-test quality management system
    + a coaching model 
    + a team-focused strategy for rapid deployment 
    + a complete, operational process 
    + supported by training and tools

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Use structured processes
    + Knowledge work is most effective when it is done using a @color[green](defined, structured process) with repeatable and measurable steps that provide workers with rapid feedback on the quality of the product and progress towards completion. 

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Establish a shared understanding
    + Productive teamwork requires that the team have a shared understanding what the work entails and how it is to be done. @color[green](Each member) needs to have the @color[green](same understanding) of the team goals, team member’s roles, products or components to be produced, available resources and existing constraints, and measures of success.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Use proven techniques
    + Knowledge work, whether done by individuals or teams, is most productive when it is based on @color[green](sound professional practices and proven techniques) as relevant to the desired outcome. TSP provides a framework and guidelines that are based on proven best practices for organizational oversight, team management, personal discipline, and process improvement at the individual, team, project, and enterprise levels.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Use data whenever and wherever possible
    + @color[green](Plans, estimates, process improvement decisions, quality ratings), and all other aspects of the development process should be @color[green](based on data) whenever possible. To get useful data for future projects, data on current projects should be carefully and accurately gathered and recorded as close as possible to the actual time of the data generation.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Make realistic plans and commitments
    + The only @color[green](realistic plans and commitments) are those that @color[green](are made by the individual)(s) responsible for meeting them: team plans and team commitments must be made by the teams who will do the work. Any commitment should be based on available data, realistic evaluation of available resources, the nature of the work, and the skills and abilities of the team.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Practice self-management
    + Knowledge workers are best enabled to do creative work when they manage themselves. This means that @color[green](individuals or teams) must be allowed to @color[green](negotiate their own commitments), @color[green](make their own plans), @color[green](follow their own chosen processes) for doing the work, @color[green](choose their own standards and methods) for ensuring good product quality.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Focus on quality
    + The primary focus of TSP team members is on @color[green](producing high quality components and products). Defective products are expensive because finding and fixing problems is both time-consuming and resource-intensive; the cost of time and resources increases exponentially when defects are discovered later rather than sooner in the process.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.2 Principios)
- Regard design as a fundamental element of quality work
    + A comprehensive and detailed @color[green](design) is one of the single @color[green](most effective defect-prevention techniques) available to developers. Even when the best implementation practices are used, the quality of the resultant products is only as good as the quality of the design methods used.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- Defined processes in TSP
    + The TSP encompasses two types of defined processes.
        * @color[green](Personal processes) are defined sets of steps or activities that guide @color[green](individuals) in doing @color[green](personal work).
        * @color[green](Team processes) are sets of defined @color[green](steps that each team member follows) in the same way when performing the team’s work.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- TSP process phases
    + The TSP process provides guidance and process examples; TSP teams define their own project processes during the team launch. This enables TSP teams to tailor their processes to the special needs of their projects, organizations, and teams. 

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- TSP process elements
    + Process elements are components of a process. The TSP uses seven basic process elements: the five @color[green](basic process elements) found in PSP (scripts, forms, measures, checklists, and standards), @color[green](plus specifications and guidelines).

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- Basic data collection measures
    + The PSP has four basic measures: @color[green](time), @color[green](size), @color[green](quality) (defects), and @color[green](schedule). These parameters are used for making estimates based on actual data (or PSP guidelines, in the absence of historical data) and for collecting data that can be used for making future estimates.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- Specifications
    + Specifications are process elements that are used in TSP but not PSP. Specifications (such as the Project Status Report and the various Role Specifications) provide clear and unambiguous @color[green](descriptions of a product), artifact, or task, and the @color[green](criteria) by which the outputs should be @color[green](evaluated).

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- Guidelines
    + Guidelines are process elements found in TSP that are used to outline the recommended @color[green](rules or strategies) that should be followed in determining a course of action.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- TSP time measures
    + As in PSP, the TSP time measure is @color[green](minutes). Time is tracked while doing the work. The six basic components of time data are start time, start date, end time, end date, interrupt time, and delta time. 

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- TSP task hours
    + Task hours is a measure of the @color[green](actual time) that team members @color[green](spend on scheduled project tasks). The measure is calculated by subtracting the total interrupt time from the time elapsed between the start time and end time of a task, and is recorded on the TSP time log as delta time.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- Off-task time
    + The @color[green](time spent doing things other than planned project tasks) generally is referred to as off-task time. It is not measured or tracked since it does not contribute to meeting the stated schedule goals. Off-task time includes time spent in management and administrative meetings, attending training classes, reading email, or any of the other essential activities that a team member must do.

---
### @color[brown](1.1 Conceptos de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.1.3 Proceso)
- TSP quality measures
    + The explicit TSP quality measures are the numbers of @color[green](defects injected and removed by phase). Derived quality measures can be calculated once the team has a complete estimated plan or actual data for the size and time of all the products and phases for which quality measures are required. 

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
- When software projects fail, it is generaly because of teamwork problems and no technical issues.
- One significant "people" @color[green](problem) is the inhability of software teams to @color[green](handle presure), especially the presure to meet an agresive developmet schedule. Often, teams respond to this pressure by taking shortcuts, using poor methods, or gambling o a new (to them) language, tool, or technique.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.1 ¿Por qué los proyectos fallan?)
- Common team problems
    + __Ineffective Leadership__. Without effective leadership, teams generally have trouble sticking to ther plans and maintaining personal discipline.
    + __Failure to Compromise or Cooperate__. Occasionally one or more team members may @color[green](no be willing or able to work cooperatively) with team.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.1 ¿Por qué los proyectos fallan?)
- Common team problems (cont...)
    + __Lack of Participation__. Team members have @color[green](different skills and abilities) as well as different motivations, energy, and levels of commitment.
    + __Procastination and Lack of Confidence__. Some teams do not set deadlines or establish goals an milestones. Others set deadlines they never meet. Such teams generally don't track performance and often fail to make decisions in a timely or logical way.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.1 ¿Por qué los proyectos fallan?)
- Common team problems (cont...)
    + __Poor Quality__. Quality problems can come from many sources. Examples are @color[green](superficial requirements inspection), a @color[green](poorly documented design), or @color[green](sloppy implementation practices). When teams do not use personal reviews or team inspections, they usualy have quality problems, resulting in extensive testing, delayed schedules, long hours, and unsatisfactory final product.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.1 ¿Por qué los proyectos fallan?)
- Common team problems (cont...)
    + __Function Creep__. During product design and implementation, engineers often @color[green](see ways to improve) their product. These well-intentioned modifications are @color[green](hard to control) because they originate from a legitimate desire to produce a better result.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.1 ¿Por qué los proyectos fallan?)
- Common team problems (cont...)
    + __Ineffective Peer Evaluation__. Experience has shown that peer evaluation can be invaluable for student teams. However, @color[green](students are often reluctant to grade their teammates) and rarely do so with complete candor.

---
### @color[brown](1.2 Lógica de TSP)
#### @color[orange](1.2.2 Creación de equipos TSP)
- To build effective teams, you need more than just the right kinds of tasks and working conditions. The team must have an important job to do and must be in an enviroment than supports teamwork. The team must face an aggressive challenge and must be encouraged to plan and manage its own tasks. These needs are met by providing the team with four additional kinds of support: @color[green](cohesion), @color[green](goals), @color[green](feedback) and a @color[green](common working framework).
