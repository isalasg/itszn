### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](TSP team roles)
- A role can be defined as the rights, obligations, and expected behavior patterns associated with a particular social status. The TSP roles describe what each person on the team is expected to do and transform team members from followers to co-managers of the project. The TSP roles cover all aspects of team management from customer interface issues to testing, and from process management to quality control.

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](TSP team roles)
- There are two types of team member roles in the TSP: the general team member role, and eight (or more) designated manager roles. Each member of a TSP team is expected to fulfill the general team member role responsibilities in addition to the duties of one or more manager roles. 

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](The TSP general team member role)
- All team members are expected to follow a disciplined personal process to plan, manage, and report on the tasks done to carry out the team’s work, and they must meet their personal commitment to produce quality products. They are also expected to keep the team leader and team members informed of their project status. 

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](The TSP general team member role)
- In order to produce quality products, team members should prevent defects whenever possible, remove defects as early in the process as possible, and record data on every defect that they find, and then use the data to improve their personal process.
- Team members are expected to cooperate with the other members of the team to maintain an effective and productive working environment.

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](The TSP manager roles)
- The standard TSP roles divide the principal team management responsibilities among all of the members. Roles allow each member of the team to handle a specific subset of the overall job so that the necessary key tasks for running a team are handled expeditiously and effectively. 

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](The TSP manager roles)
- To ensure maximum efficiency in carrying out the role duties, team members should be familiar with the expectations not only of their own personal role, but also those of all the other roles; this helps to avoid duplicated effort.
