### @color[brown](3.1. Introducción)
- Once the team members have been properly trained and the team has been formed, the entire team participates in the TSP team launch. By following the launch process, teams produce a detailed plan. To become a cohesive and effective working unit, all the team members must be committed to the plan. To build this commitment, the TSP involves all the team members in producing that plan.

---
### @color[brown](3.1. Introducción)
- Thus, by completing the TSP launch process, all the team members will have participated in producing the plan and they will all agree with and be committed to the plan that they produced.

### @color[brown](3.2. Proceso de lanzamiento)
#### @color[orange](Team Goals and Roles)
- The general guideline for setting goals is to firs consider que would be a superior result in the eyes of your customer. There are three basic goals:
    + Produce quality product.
    + Run a productive and well-managed project.
    + Finish on time





Develop the quality plan.
- In order to produce quality products, team members should prevent defects whenever possible, remove defects as early in the process as possible, and record data on every defect that they find, and then use the data to improve their personal process.
- Team members are expected to cooperate with the other members of the team to maintain an effective and productive working environment.

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
#### @color[orange](The TSP manager roles)
- The standard TSP roles divide the principal team management responsibilities among all of the members. Roles allow each member of the team to handle a specific subset of the overall job so that the necessary key tasks for running a team are handled expeditiously and effectively. 

---
### @color[brown](Introducción)
